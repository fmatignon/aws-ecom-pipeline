description: How to use console logs

Agents must ensure all print/log statements include a UTC timestamp and clearly state which section of the script is executing. At the start and end of each principal section or operation, log the event with messages such as:

print(f"[{datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] Starting: <Section Description>")
print(f"[{datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] Completed: <Section Description>")

For time-consuming processes, initiate the log with a start print, then use progress prints with end="", flush=True to indicate ongoing activity, but remove these progress prints once the process completes—retaining only the start and completion logs.

If errors occur during script execution, they must be caught and printed with a UTC timestamp, clearly indicating that an error was encountered along with the section where it happened, for example:

except Exception as e:
    print(f"[{datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] Error in <Section Description>: {e}")

This format should be used consistently throughout the codebase for error handling and reporting.

Do not include emojis, informal language, or custom separator lines in any prints. Maintain a concise, professional, and informative tone with consistent log formatting throughout the codebase. Avoid referencing transient variable values or previous execution context; prints should be clear to new readers and convey only relevant script execution context.
