description: How to comment on files

Every code file must start with a triple-quoted (""") docstring comment at the very top explaining the file's purpose and what it does.

Every function, method, or class must have a succinct triple-quoted (""") docstring explaining its purpose, usage, and a brief description of each parameter.

Use inline comments sparingly; keep them brief and only when necessary to clarify complex logic.

Do not reference specific variable values or dialog history in comments; assume readers are unfamiliar with the codebase.

Maintain a professional, concise, and informative tone in all comments. Don't include emojis.
